Exercise 1

Consider a scheme similar to Homework 3, Part a
where M systems are subject to a series of N attacks. A system is discarded as "unsecure" if it reaches a penetration score of P before reaching, instead, a security score of S. Simulate and represent the probabilities of a system being discarded, for various values of P, example: P = k*10 (k=2,...,10), conditional on the 3 cases for S: S = 20, S = 60, S = 100 (or any other value of S of your choice that you find useful to explore (it could be a user parameter).


Research
Find out on the web about the "Gambler's Ruin Problem". See if you can see any analogy with this exercise and make your personal consideration about what your simulation is suggesting to you.
