Homework 5 (2-9/11/2023)

Exercise

M servers are subject to attacks during a period of time T (for instance 1 year).
Subdivide the interval T in N subinterval of size T/N and in each of this suppose that
an attack can occur with probability Î» T/N.
Simulate the attacks to the M servers and represent each of them with a line which
makes jumps of 1 at each attack event.

Using the same objects ("movable/resizable rectangle", histogram, etc.) of the previous homework 3
draw vertically on the line chart the 2 histograms representing the distribution of the number
of attacks at the end of the period and one internal istant for comparison.

Study what happens asymptotically, for N large, and a number of systems M a sufficient to give shape to
a simulated distribution. Make some personal considerations about the shape and the average of the distributions that you see.


Research
Find out on the web about a Poisson point process. See if you can see any analogy with this Exercise and verify whether your distributions come close (for N, M sufficiently large) to the theoretical asymptotic distribution.
