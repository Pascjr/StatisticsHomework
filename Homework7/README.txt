Homework 9 (2 weeks from 16/11)

Exercise

Consider a scheme similar to Homework 3

First of all realize that the general scheme that you used so far (random walk and also Poisson process, etc.), can, more in general,
be used for any stochastic differential equations SDE (see, for instance, Euler–Maruyama method https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Maruyama_method).

In other words, with minor additions to your program you can now generalize this tool to simulate almost any stochastic
differential equations of interest for many applications

Create a web only version where you allow the user to explore (selectable by user) any useful stochastic process.

Do a research on the web and include any SDE that you think its interesting. Some examples of popular processes:

Arithmetic Brownian
Geometric Brownian (Black–Scholes)
Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (mean-reverting)
Vasicek
Hull–White
Cox–Ingersoll–Ross
Black–Karasinski
Heston
Chen model
[... any other interesting ...]
